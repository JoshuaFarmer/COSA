By (By is the byte offset (16 bit because there are >255 bytes in each sector)

Sp (Sp is a 8 bit integer. Sp = meta sector pointer (a "meta sector" contains the name, and location of the file))
Cl (Cl is the cylinder/track (8 bit))
Hd (Hd is the head (8 bit))

C (C is a 32 bit integer, deciding how many file pointer sectors exist, this means its not fixed at some value (e.g. 256))

ig Hd:Cl:Sp:By means head[Hd].sector[Sp].byteIndex(By)

START OF DISK:
    "WFSE V1"\0, C, (drive meta data, that we dont care about (fill the rest of the first sector with 0s))
example pointer:
	Hd:Cl:Sp:By,
    first <C> sectors are for file pointers

(sector <Sp>:<By>):
    <start> <end> <name>
(<start>):
	(data until <end>)
