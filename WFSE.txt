note: 1 pointer is 32 bits (4 bytes).

Sp (Sp is a 8 bit integer. Sp = meta sector pointer (a "meta sector" contains the name, and location of the file))
Cl (Cl is the cylinder/track (8 bit))
Hd (Hd is the head (8 bit))
Dr (Dr is the drive number (8 bit))

C (C is a 16 bit integer, deciding how many file pointer sectors exist, this means its not fixed at some value (e.g. 256))

ig Dr:Hd:Cl:Sp means drive.[Dr].head[Hd].track.[Cl].sector[Sp]

pointer = Dr:Hd:Cl:Sp

START OF FS (sector 5):
    "WFSE V1"\0, C, (drive meta data, that we dont care about (fill the rest of the first sector with 0s))
example pointers:
    pointer, pointer, pointer, pointer, pointer
    first <C> sectors are for file pointers

(sector <Sp>):
    <file len (sectors (8 bit))> <name> <meta for the rest of the first sector>
    (data until <end>)
