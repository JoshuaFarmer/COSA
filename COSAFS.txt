D (D is a 32 bit integer. D = meta sector (which contains the name, and location of the file))
S (S is a 32 bit integer, deciding how many file pointer sectors exist, this means its not fixed at some value (e.g. 256))

START OF DISK:
    "WFSE V1", S, (drive meta data, that we dont care about)
	D, D, D, D, D...
    first <S> sectors are for files ((S*512)/4 files max, bitch)

(sector <D>):
    <start> <end> <name>
